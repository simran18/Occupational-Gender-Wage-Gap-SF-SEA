# Occupational Gender Wage Gap SF SEA
The gender wage gap is prevalent all across the world in a wide range of occupations—the goal of this study is to analyze the trend of this gap focusing on the technology jobs in Seattle and San Francisco, given the history of gender representation in this field. This trend is analyzed over the years from 2014 to 2016 for both cities. Based on the exploratory analysis, a null hypothesis is formed that the mean wage difference between men and women of Seattle and San Francisco is the same. After performing statistical modelling of Welch’s t-test for both subcategories of professions, weak evidence is found against the null hypothesis, so the decision is to fail to reject the null hypothesis.  Additionally, comparing the wage gap in Seattle and San Francisco, it was found that women make 88 cents the dollar of men in Seattle and 86 cents in San Francisco.
